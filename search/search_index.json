Prerequisites An active Alibaba Cloud account Familiarity with cloud services and AI models Step 1: Alibaba Cloud Account Setup Ensure you have an Alibaba Cloud account. Sign up here if you still need to do so. Step 2: Access Compute Nest Find the service GenAI-LLM-RAG in Alibaba Cloud->Console->Compute Nest with your Alibaba Cloud credentials. And press the \"Offical Use.\" Step 3: Set Up an Instance and Its Parameters Set up the necessary parameters of the instance: 1. Enter the service instance name 2. Choose ECS (Elastic Computing Services) parameters. Recommended to choose ecs.c6.2xlarge. In this case, the uploaded document will be faster 3. Insert instance password Step 4: Create a PAI-EAS Service for LLM Deploy a pre-trained LLM on PAI-EAS: 1. Choose the suitable LLM from the menu. 2. Set the instance type 3. Deploy and note the API endpoint. Step 5: Setup AnalyticDB for PostgreSQL Choose the AnalyticDB for PostgreSQL instance specification. Segment Storage Size: The size of the documents could be decided depending on your knowledge. The default DB username is \"kbsuser\". Usually, the database name will be the same as the user name. Feel free to put another username. You need to create a strong password, for instance. Note: not use in a password symbol \"@\" Step 6: WebUI Credential and Network Configuration The default username is \"admin\". You could choose another username. You need to create a strong password, for instance. As VPC can be chosen from existing VPC. To create a new VPC, you can activate the slider and put related information. After, press \"Next: Confirm Order.\" Step 7: Integrate Gradio for Web UI Create a web UI with Gradio: 1. Set up Gradio. 2. Connect it to the backend services (PAI-EAS, vector store). Step 8: Deploy Your RAG Service After checking all related information and accepting the \"Terms of Service\" by pressing \"Create Now,\" the service can be deployed. Need to wait for a while to finish all the steps. Using the RAG Service General Question Answering Users can ask questions through the Gradio web UI, and the LLM will process and provide answers. Uploading Documents for Retrieval Augmentation Users can upload documents converted into vector store and save them in AnalyticDB for PostgreSQL. Modifying the Service via ECS Authorized users can access ECS to make changes or updates to the service.
